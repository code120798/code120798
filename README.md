### 👨‍💻 About Me :
Welcome to my profile! I recently graduated with a diploma in Front End Development - HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as using Github to store my repositories. I am able to present clean and re-usable code along with clear comments that explains my code for anyone to understand. I have excellent communication skills that I developed working in the Hospitality industry for 6 years. I am open to learning and developing new skills. I have built 3 projects as part of my course and I have enrolled onto another course on Udemy to practice and increase my skills. Currently seeking an opportunity to work as a Junior Front End Developer!
